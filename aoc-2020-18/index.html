<h1>Advent of Code 2020 Day 18: Rethinking Operator Precedence</h1>

<p><strong>12/27/20</strong></p>

<p>Part 2 of  <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/18">AOC Day 18</a> asks
you to evaluate some math expressions, but with a twist.
<code>+</code> has a greater operator precedence than <code>*</code>.
(This is opposite of how we typically read math):</p>

<pre><code>2 * 3 + (4 * 5)
2 * 3 + 20
2 * 23
46
</code></pre>

<p>The standard method for expression evaluation is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunting-yard_algorithm">shunting yard</a> algorithm.
This is the <em>right</em> and efficient way to solve this problem.
But, it&rsquo;s also not very obvious or natural.
It&rsquo;s hard to imagine how you would think if it yourself,
and doesn&rsquo;t really match how people actually see mathematical expressions.</p>

<p>I want to show off an alternative solution demonstrating
how you could think of it yourself.
My code is written in Common Lisp.
For this particular problem this choice goes a bit deeper than just syntax
as the solution makes heavy use of a symbolic expression manipulation which is harder to do in most languages.</p>

<p><strong>Thinking about Precedence</strong></p>

<p>What does operator precedence actually mean?
It tells us the <em>order in which to evaluate operators</em>.
So naively we should just do all the additions first, and then the multiplications.
Can we program that?
We certainly can, but doing just one operation at a time,
means at each step we produce an intermediate result which is itself a math expression, just simplified a bit.
For example given the expression:</p>

<pre><code> (1 + 2 * 3 + 4)
</code></pre>

<p>We first evaluate all the <code>+</code> to produce:</p>

<pre><code>(3 * 7)
</code></pre>

<p>And then we evaluate all the &lsquo;*&rsquo; to produce:</p>

<pre><code>(21)
</code></pre>

<p>After evaluating every operator, we should get a list containing a single number.</p>

<p>Below is some code which does just that.
The input <code>chain</code> is an expression (list of numbers and operators)
and <code>allowed</code> is the operator we want to evaluate.</p>

<pre><code>(defun simplify-chain (chain allowed)
  (prog ((result '())
         (op nil)
         (l nil)
         (r nil))

        (setf l (car chain))
        (setf chain (cdr chain))

        loop
        (setf op (car chain))
        (setf chain (cdr chain))

        (setf r (car chain))
        (setf chain (cdr chain))

        (if (eq op allowed)

            ; evaluate the operation.
            ; put the result back in the expression

            (setf l (funcall op l r))

            ; not an operation we want to evaluate right now.
            ; put it's symbols back in an the expression
            (progn (push l result)
                   (push op result)
                   (setf l r)))

        (if (consp chain)
            (go loop))

        (push l result)
        (return (reverse result))))
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Handling Parenthesis</strong></p>

<p>That is quite straightforward!
All the trickiness is fiddling with infix.
But, there is one problem.
Due to parenthesis the operands may not be &ldquo;ready&rdquo; to evaluate.
If we have:</p>

<pre><code>3 + (2 * 4)
</code></pre>

<p>We can&rsquo;t apply the <code>+</code> operation until the <code>(2 * 4)</code> is taken care of.
But evaluating <code>(2 * 4)</code> is something we could do directly.
There are only finitely many nested
statements, so eventually following parenthesis must end with a list containing only numbers and operators.
This is clearly a recursive problem!
We need to evaluate all the parenthesized statements in a list, before we can evaluate
the list itself.</p>

<p>The algorithm for evaluation looks like the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>To evaluate a number or operator symbol, just return it. (base case)</li>
<li><p>To evaluate a list:</p>

<ol>
<li>evaluate every entry in the list. (take care of parenthesis)</li>
<li>simplify the expression by applying each operator in order. (simplify chain)</li>
<li>Return the only item left in the list.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>


<p>Let&rsquo;s write an eval function which does this, building upon simplify chain:</p>

<pre><code>(defun eval-expr (expr)
  (if (listp expr)
        (car (reduce #'simplify-chain 
                     '(+ *)
                     :initial-value (mapcar #'eval-expr expr)))
        expr))
</code></pre>

<p>To summarize <code>simplify-chain</code> takes mathematical expressions
and returns expressions that are simpler, while <code>eval-expr</code> always returns a number.
Note that this works for any number of operators and adjusting
precedence is as simple as changing the order of the <code>'(+ *)</code> list.</p>
