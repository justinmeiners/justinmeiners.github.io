Justin Meiners
==============

Welcome to my personal website!
I love learning and creating new projects.
I hope to share some of them with you.
Feel free to contact me at: <span>![justin's email](mail.png)</span>

## Background

Here is a little about my background and interests:

- I first learned to program in 2008 using [Objective-C](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ObjectiveC/Introduction/introObjectiveC.html) and Cocoa/NextStep thanks to the [CMSEC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christa_McAuliffe_Space_Education_Center).
- I am a Software Engineer in the Vision Products Group at [Apple](https://www.apple.com/) (I do not write about my employer's products or business).
- My best effort at a professional title is "computer vision generalist". My skills include 3D rendering, GPUs, numerical methods, optimization, combinatorics, signal processing, etc.
- I have a Master's degree in math and view it as a lifelong pursuit. I have broad knowledge at the "advanced undergrad" level with more depth in real analysis and topology.

- I like 3D modeling and texturing, but I am not much of a visual artist. I learned by tinkering with [anim8or](https://www.anim8or.com). Now I use Blender. However, I am not a very good artist.
- I enjoy reading philosophy, especially Plato and Aristotle.
