Justin Meiners
==============

Welcome to my personal website!
I love learning and creating new projects.
I hope to share some of them with you.
Feel free to contact me at: <span>![justin's email](mail.png)</span>

## Background

Here is a little about my background and interests:

- I first learned to program in 2008 using Objective-C and Cocoa/NextStep. My favorite languages are C and Lisp.
- I am a Software Engineer at [Apple](https://www.apple.com/) (I do not write about my employer's business or products).
- I have a Master's degree in math. I am familar with many areas at an "advanced undergrad" level, but my best subjects are Real Analysis and Topology.
- I write software in a variety of technical domains including 3D graphics, numerical methods, optimization, combinatorics, signal processing, etc.
- I like 3D modeling and texturing. I learned from anim8or and now use Blender. But I am not much of an artist.
- I enjoy reading philosophy, especially Early Modern and Ancient Greek. Plato is my favorite.
