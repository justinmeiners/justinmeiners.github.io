![finger painting](finger_painting.jpg)

Welcome to my personal site!
I am currently a Software Engineer at [PassiveLogic](https://passive-logic.com/).

Throughout my career I have worked in many different areas of software including mobile, web, computer graphics, and cryptocurrency.
I also have a Master's degree in math where I studied topology.
If you are interested in my professional experience, see my [CV](files/cv.pdf).

Feel free to contact me at ![justin's email](mail.gif).
