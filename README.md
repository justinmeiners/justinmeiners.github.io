Welcome to my personal site!
I enjoy learning, especially about computers, math, and philosophy.
Creating projects is my preferred way to learn and have fun.
Feel free to contact me at: <span>![justin's email](mail.png)</span>

## Work

I am currently a Software Engineer at [PassiveLogic](https://passive-logic.com/).
Throughout my career I have worked in many different areas of software including mobile, web, computer graphics, and cryptocurrency.
I also have a Master's degree in math where I studied topology.
If you are interested in my professional experience, see my [CV](files/cv.pdf).
