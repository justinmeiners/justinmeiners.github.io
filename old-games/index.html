<h2>Old Games</h2>

<p><strong>10/09/2015</strong></p>

<p>I spent quite a bit of time experimenting with game technology when I was first learning how to program. I played with tons of ideas, many of which turned out to be no good, but I learned a ton about graphics and development in the process.</p>

<p>An extremely fast minecraft clone. Written in C and OpenGL.</p>

<p><img src="lightmap.jpg" alt="lightmap screenshot" /></p>

<p>I wrote my own lightmapper and UV unwrapper in Objective-C.</p>

<p><img src="asteroids.jpg" alt="asteroids screenshot" /></p>

<p>A small demo for a sci-fi adventure game engine. Written in C and OpenGL.</p>

<p><img src="ocean.jpg" alt="ocean screenshot" /></p>

<p>An adventure game in which players explore the ocean. One feature I like allows the player to take a picture and store it in an album. The game recognizes which fish are in the picture so it can reward them for collecting them all.</p>

<p><img src="platform.jpg" alt="platform screenshot" /></p>

<p>An action platform game where players avoid obstacles by jumping and running up walls.</p>

<p><img src="restock.jpg" alt="restock screenshot" /></p>

<p>A puzzle game I created for a school competition. Written in C++ and OpenGL.</p>

<p><img src="shooter.jpg" alt="shooter screenshot" /></p>

<p>A platform shooter game.</p>

<p><img src="strategy.jpg" alt="strategy screenshot" /></p>

<p>A prototype of a strategy game for iOS.</p>
