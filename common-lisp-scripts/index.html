<h2>Deploying Common Lisp Scripts</h2>

<p><strong>3/05/22</strong></p>

<p>You want a Common Lisp workflow that&rsquo;s just like Python or Perl,
so you can write scripts!
No dumping images, or complex deployments.
Just install <em>a single lisp interpreter</em> on your computer (<code>/usr/local/bin/sbcl</code>) and
<em>write, run, and share</em> source files.
Here I&rsquo;ll explain how to do that.</p>

<p>A step in the right direction is a <code>.lisp</code> file with an appropriate shebang:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/sbcl --script
(write-string "Hello, World!")
</code></pre>

<p>But you&rsquo;ll quickly run into a few roadblocks.
How do you include other source files without knowing their installation path?
How do you load libraries such as through Quicklisp?</p>

<p>The solution? (<strong>TLDR</strong>) Quicklisp has a command for downloading libraries and exporting them called <strong><a href="https://www.quicklisp.org/beta/bundles.html">ql:bundle-systems</a></strong>.
It creates a single folder with an index file called <code>bundle.lisp</code>.
After running <code>(load bundle.lisp)</code>, all of your dependencies are available to be load via <code>asdf:load-system</code>.</p>

<h2>How to use <code>ql:bundle-system</code></h2>

<ol>
<li><p>Create a bundle containing your Quicklisp dependencies:</p>

<pre><code> (ql:bundle-systems (list "alexandria" "cl-ppcre" ...) :to "bundle/")
</code></pre>

<p> This <code>bundle/</code> folder will contain  <code>alexandria</code> and <code>cl-ppcre</code>, along with their transitive dependencies.
 Each package will be organized as its own an <code>asdf</code> system.</p></li>
<li><p>Create an <code>.asd</code> file describing your project and its (See <a href="https://asdf.common-lisp.dev/asdf.html#Defining-systems-with-defsystem">defsystem docs</a> for details).</p>

<pre><code> (asdf:defsystem "my-lisp-program"
     :depends-on (:alexandria :cl-ppcre ...)
     :build-pathname "my-lisp-program"
     :components (
         (:file "...")
         ...))
</code></pre>

<p> The <code>:depends-on</code> list must only reference systems which were downloaded by <code>ql:bundle-systems</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Copy your application source in the bundle:</p>

<pre><code> $ mkdir -p bundle/local-projects/my-lisp-program
 $ cp *.lisp bundle/local-projects/my-lisp-program
 $ cp *.asd bundle/local-projects/my-lisp-program
</code></pre>

<p> Now your code is just another <code>asdf:system</code>, alongside the others.</p></li>
<li><p>Install the bundle in a global system path:</p>

<pre><code> $ cp -r bundle/ /usr/local/lib/my-lisp-program
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Create a brief script which loads the <code>bundle.lisp</code> and the <code>asdf</code> system. For example <code>my-lisp-program</code></p>

<pre><code> #!/usr/bin/sbcl --script
 (load "/usr/local/lib/my-lisp-program/bundle.lisp")
 (asdf:load-system "myapp")
 (my-lisp-program:do-stuff)
</code></pre>

<p> <code>asdf:load-system</code> will examine your projects <code>.asd</code> file and load its dependencies, transitively.</p></li>
<li><p>Install the launch script in a global system path:</p>

<pre><code> $ mv my-lisp-program /usr/local/bin/
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Run your script!</p>

<pre><code> $ my-lisp-program
</code></pre></li>
</ol>


<p>That&rsquo;s all! Consider automating these steps for your project, such as with <code>make install</code>.</p>

<p>The first time you run the script you may see a long log
as <code>sbcl</code> compiles the code into <code>.fasl</code> files.
These will be used for faster loads on subsequent runs.</p>

<h2>Why other solutions didn&rsquo;t work for me</h2>

<p>There are a myriad of articles that claim to solve this problem.
But after much research and trial and error, I found none of them to be satisfactory.
Let&rsquo;s review them:</p>

<h3>Dumping an image</h3>

<p>The popular advice for deploying Common Lisp is to <a href="https://lispcookbook.github.io/cl-cookbook/scripting.html">dump an image</a> of the compiler (<code>save-lisp-and-die</code>),</p>

<p>This makes a copy of the entire Lisp compiler with your source code included.
This is a good solution for large applications.
For example, if you want to deploy a web application to server,
it&rsquo;s pretty convenient to <code>scp</code> up an image file and be done.</p>

<p>However, it&rsquo;s quite cumbersome if you have more than a handful to keep track of.
Your computer becomes littered with a bunch of independent copies of Lisp.
If you want to update <code>sbcl</code> you need to track down all your old images, delete them, and rebuild new ones.
Images files are also notoriously large (~50 MB for <code>sbcl</code>).</p>

<h3>Using Quicklisp in scripts</h3>

<p>Can you make a shebang script that loads code with Quicklisp?
You certainly can, but first note that <code>sbcl --script</code> will skip Lisp your system configuration (<code>.sbclrc</code>),
so you need to hard code a path to load Quicklisp.</p>

<p>But now imaging if calling <code>import</code> in a Python started downloading code from the internet!
That&rsquo;s a security and reliability nightmare.
But that&rsquo;s how Quicklisp works!</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s because Quicklisp isn&rsquo;t intended to be a library loader.
It&rsquo;s a tool for downloading and <em>discovering</em> libraries.
But it shouldn&rsquo;t be included with your program.</p>

<p>You should be using <code>asdf</code> for that instead.
It&rsquo;s the standard way to describe and load libraries,
and it&rsquo;s already included in most distributions.</p>

<p>Note that Quicklisp is also organized as a rolling release like your operating system.
Rather than picking out individual library version tags, you pick a Quicklisp version which
is a snapshot in time of all the libraries that aims to be compatible.</p>

<p>To reiterate the relationship between Quicklisp and <code>asdf</code>,
I will borrow an explanation from Reddit user <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/lisp/comments/iai2ab/repairing_asdf_package_storage/g1pnxdt/">eayse</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>I advocate the habit of installing things with <code>ql:quickload</code>, but after initial installation, using <code>asdf:load-system</code> to actually bring the systems into memory.
After all missing dependencies have been satisfied by network installations from the distributions configured in Quicklisp, <code>ql:quickload</code> just thunks down to ASDF.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Roswell?</h3>

<p><a href="https://roswell.github.io/Roswell-as-a-Scripting-Environment.html">Roswell</a> is advertised as a solution, but it&rsquo;s possibly the most un-Lispy tool in the ecosystem.
It doesn&rsquo;t download dependencies, or help you build them.
What does it do? Help you download sbcl?
Why in the world does it use a config file syntax that isn&rsquo;t s-expressions?
Why is part of it written in C?
<em>sigh</em>.</p>

<h2>Busybox style</h2>

<p>The overhead of dumping an image can be shared by putting many scripts into a single image, instead of making an image for each.
I call this &ldquo;Busybox style&rdquo; because it was popularized in C by the <a href="https://fare.livejournal.com/184127.html">Busybox</a> project.
For a Common Lisp tutorial, see <a href="https://stevelosh.com/blog/2021/03/small-common-lisp-cli-programs/">Steve &rsquo;s article</a>.</p>

<p>This certainly solves some of the disk usage problems.
But it&rsquo;s kind of a crutch, and the workflow is just not as good as Python.</p>
